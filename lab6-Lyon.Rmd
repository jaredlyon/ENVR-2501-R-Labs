```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Task 1
```{r}
# Download the data
d1 <- read.csv("http://faraway.neu.edu/biostats/lab6_dataset1.csv")
str(d1)
```

## 1.
```{r}
qqnorm(d1$score)
qqline(d1$score)
```

A transformation is recommended because the data is not normally distributed.

## 2.
A log10 transformation is the most applicable:
```{r}
qqnorm(log10(d1$score))
qqline(log10(d1$score), col = "blue")
```

## 3.
```{r}
hiv.aov <- aov(log10(score) ~ drug1 * drug2, d1)
summary(hiv.aov)
```

## 4.
Drug 1 has a significance score of >0.1, indicating a statistically insignificant difference in its viral scoring mean.
Drug 1 & Drug 2 together have a significance score of between 0 and 0.001, indicating a statistically significant difference in its viral scoring mean that is greater than that of Drug 1 alone.
Drug 2 has a significance score of between 0 and 0.001, indicating a statistically significant difference in its viral scoring mean out of all the treatment combinations.

## 5.
```{r}
hiv.tukey <- TukeyHSD(hiv.aov)
hiv.tukey
plot(hiv.tukey)
```

## 6.
The d1.trt:d2.ctrl-d1.ctrl:d2.ctrl comparison has a positive HIV score mean difference with a p-adj > 0.05, indicating that drug 1 alone neither effective nor does it elucidate a statistically significant effect.
The d1.ctrl:d2.trt-d1.ctrl:d2.ctrl comparison has a negative HIV score mean difference with a p-adj < 0.05, indicating that drug 2 alone is effective in a statistically significant manner.
The d1.trt:d2.trt-d1.ctrl:d2.ctrl comparison has the greatest negative HIV score mean difference with a p-adj < 0.05, indicating that drugs 1 & 2 together are the most effective treatment option; this result is also extremely statistically significant.


## 7.
```{r}
require(multcompView, quietly = TRUE)
# Compute the mean and std error of each group. You can do this a different way, if you like
means <- tapply(log10(d1$score), list(d1$drug1, d1$drug2), mean)
means
stderrs <- tapply(log10(d1$score), list(d1$drug1, d1$drug2), function(x) sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)))
# Assign a label to each bar. You will need to insert the name of your model object
labels <- multcompLetters(hiv.tukey$`drug1:drug2`[, "p adj"])$Letters
# Order the labels
labels <- labels[order(names(labels))]
# Plot the figure
bp <- barplot(means, beside = TRUE, ylab = "HIV Score Means", col = c("white", "darkgray"), ylim = c(0, 4))
arrows(x0 = bp, y0 = means - stderrs, y1 = means + stderrs, angle = 90,
len = 0.1, code = 3, xpd = NA)
text(x = bp, y = means + stderrs, pos = 3, lab = labels, xpd = NA)
box()
legend(x = "topright", legend = c("d1.ctrl", "d1.trt"),
fill = c("white", "darkgray"))
```

## 8.
```{r}
interaction.plot(d1$drug1, d1$drug2, log10(d1$score))
```

## 9.
The results suggest that a concoction of drug 1 and drug 2 are the most statistically effective in reducing the viral load score. Drug 1 does not appear to be effective, whereas drug 2 appears statistically effective although not moreso than the concoction of both drugs.

# Task 2
```{r}
# Download the data
d2 <- read.csv("http://faraway.neu.edu/biostats/lab6_dataset2.csv")
str(d2)
```

## 1.
```{r}
hiv.aov.2 <- aov(log10(score) ~ drug1 * drug2 * sex, d2)
summary(hiv.aov.2)
```

## 2.
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
interaction.plot(d2$drug1, d2$sex, log10(d2$score))
interaction.plot(d2$drug2, d2$sex, log10(d2$score))
```

## 3.
The interaction plots suggest that drug 2 is significantly effective in reducing HIV viral means for both males and females whereas drug 1 is mostly effective for women, but not so much for men.

## 4.
```{r}
# Compute mean and standard error for each group
means <- aggregate(log10(score) ~ drug1 + drug2 + sex, FUN = mean, data = d2)
means
stderrs <- aggregate(log10(score) ~ drug1 + drug2 + sex, FUN = function(x) sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)), data = d2)
stderrs
# Perform multiple comparisons
mod.aov.tukey <- TukeyHSD(hiv.aov.2)
# Generate labels for each bar
labels <- multcompLetters(mod.aov.tukey$`drug1:drug2:sex`[,"p adj"])$Letters
labels <- labels[order(names(labels))]
# Plot bars
bp <- barplot(cbind(means[0:4, 4], means[5:8, 4]), beside = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 4), ylab = "HIV Score Means", col = c("white", "lightgray", "darkgray", "black"))
arrows(x0 = bp, x1 = bp, y0 = means$`log10(score)` - stderrs$`log10(score)`, y1 = means$`log10(score)` + stderrs$`log10(score)`, angle = 90,
len = 0.1, code = 3, xpd = NA)
# Add labels for Males and Females
text(x = colMeans(bp)[1:4], y = -0.5, label = "Female", xpd = NA)
text(x = colMeans(bp)[5:8], y = -0.5, label = "Male", xpd = NA)
box()
# Add bar labels based on multiple comparisons
text(x = bp, y = means[, 4] + stderrs[, 4], pos = 3, lab = labels,
xpd = NA)
# Create appropriate labels for the legend to describe
# the treatments
legend(x = "topright", legend = c("d1.ctrl-d2.ctrl", "d1.trt-d2.ctrl", "d1.ctrl-d2.trt", "d1.trt-d2.trt"),
fill = c("white", "lightgray", "darkgray", "black"))
```

## 5.
For females, drug 2 alone is the most effective in curbing HIV virality, whereas men require a concoction of drug 1 and drug 2 for the most significant reduction.
